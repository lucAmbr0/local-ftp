Local-FTP is a full-stack project for file sharing on a local network. It includes a Java Swing-based server that hosts files and a responsive React app for mobile and desktop access. Users can upload and download files via the web app, with optional (insecure, educational use only) password protection. The Java app features a minimal, easy-to-use interface, while the React frontend offers a clean, modern design. Local-FTP is simple to set up, ideal for LAN environments, and requires no internet connectionâ€”perfect for classrooms or quick local transfers without external dependencies.
